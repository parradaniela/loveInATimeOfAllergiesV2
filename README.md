# Love in a Time of Allergies V2

## Overview

A refactored version of an old group project from my time at Juno College of Technology's bootcamp! The original version was designed with React, and this version builds upon the original by adding Typescript. The app (when complete) will allow a user to create and save dinner parties, assign guests with dietary restrictions to the dinner party, and fetch recipe data from a REST API that is filtered to account for the dietary restrictions of the entire group.
