# Love in a Time of Allergies V2

## Overview

A refactored version of an old group project from my time at Juno College of Technology's bootcamp! The original version was designed with React, and this version builds upon the original by adding Typescript. The app allows a user to create and save dinner parties to a Firebase database, assign guests and their dietary restrictions to the dinner party, then fetch recipe data from a REST API that is filtered to account for the dietary restrictions of the entire group.
