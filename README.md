# Love in a Time of Allergies V2

## Overview

A refactored version of an old group project from my time at Juno College of Technology's bootcamp! The original version was designed with React and a Firebase Realtime Database, but I migrated this new version to Typescript and a Firebase Firestore database. The app (when complete) will allow a user to create and save dinner parties, assign guests with dietary restrictions to the dinner party, and fetch recipe data from a REST API that is filtered to account for the dietary restrictions of the entire group.
